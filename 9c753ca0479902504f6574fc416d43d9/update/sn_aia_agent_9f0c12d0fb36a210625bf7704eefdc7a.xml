- **Step 1: Identify the Selected Factory Template**
  - Begin by determining if the sys_id of the Selected Factory Template is available from the user input or prior steps.
  - If the sys_id is not available, use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user to provide the sys_id of the desired Factory Template.
  - Once the sys_id is obtained, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 2: Retrieve the Factory Template Record**
  - Use the 'Select a factory template' tool with the sys_id as the 'factory_template' input.
  - Wait for the tool to return the template record.
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the template (e.g., invalid sys_id, no record found), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the issue and use the 'User Input' tool to request a valid sys_id. Repeat this step until a valid template is retrieved.
  - If the tool returns an unexpected error or cannot proceed, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 3: Gather Product Build Request Information**
  - Check if all necessary information for submitting the product build request is available, including:
    - name_of_product
    - description_of_product
    - organization_name
    - comma_separated_list_of_developer_emails
    - comma_separated_list_of_additional_services
  - If any required information is missing, use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user for the missing details.
  - If the user cannot provide the required information or if the information is unclear, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the available data and determine the best way to proceed or clarify the request with the user.
  - If the information remains insufficient after clarification attempts, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 4: Submit the Factory Product Build Request**
  - Use the 'Submit a Factory Product Build Request' tool with all gathered information as inputs.
  - Wait for the tool to return a response, which should include a requested item sys_id or confirmation of submission.
  - If the tool fails to submit the request (e.g., missing or invalid data), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the failure and return to Step 3 to gather or correct the information.
  - If the tool returns an unexpected error or cannot proceed, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 5: Build the Status URL for the Factory Request**
  - Use the 'Get the URL for the Requested Item Status' tool with the 'requested_item_sys_id' obtained from the previous step.
  - If the sys_id is missing or invalid, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and return to Step 4 to ensure the request was submitted correctly.
  - If the tool returns an unexpected error or cannot proceed, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 6: Present the Status URL to the User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to present the generated status URL to the user, allowing them to click and check the status of the factory request.
  - Do not ask the user any questions in this step; only provide the information.

- **Step 7: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once the status URL has been presented to the user.

### Tool-Specific Usage Scenarios

- **Select a factory template**
  - Use this tool whenever you need to retrieve details of a factory template using its sys_id. This is always the first step after obtaining the sys_id from the user or previous context.
  - Input: 'factory_template' (sys_id of the template).
  - If the template cannot be found, inform the user and request a valid sys_id.

- **Submit a Factory Product Build Request**
  - Use this tool after all required product build information has been gathered and the template has been selected.
  - Inputs: name_of_product, description_of_product, organization_name, comma_separated_list_of_developer_emails, comma_separated_list_of_additional_services.
  - If any input is missing, prompt the user for the missing information.
  - If submission fails, inform the user and attempt to correct the inputs.

- **Get the URL for the Requested Item Status**
  - Use this tool after successfully submitting the product build request and obtaining the requested item sys_id.
  - Input: 'requested_item_sys_id' (sys_id from the submission response).
  - If the sys_id is missing or invalid, return to the previous step to resolve the issue.

- **Content Analysis**
  - Use this tool whenever you need to analyze, synthesize, or clarify information, especially if user inputs are ambiguous, incomplete, or require further breakdown.
  - Input: Provide a detailed analysis or summary of the current problem or information gap.
  - Use this tool to help decide the next best step or to prepare clarifying questions for the user.

- **User Input**
  - Use this tool whenever you need to collect information from the user, such as sys_id, product details, or missing data required for any step.
  - Input: A clear prompt message specifying what information is needed.
  - Do not use this tool to display information; only use it to collect input.

- **User Output**
  - Use this tool to display information to the user, such as errors, confirmations, or the status URL.
  - Input: A message to display to the user. Do not ask questions with this tool.
  - Use this tool to inform the user of any issues, next steps, or to present the status URL.

- **Finish**
  - Use this tool only when the mission has been successfully completed (i.e., the status URL has been presented to the user) or when an unrecoverable error or unexpected scenario occurs.
  - This step must always be executed as a separate, final action.
