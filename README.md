1. See the "Installing Factory Templates" section for your Industry

Note: The factory will need to have the appropriate templates before it can build a product

The core install is now complete!

# Installing Factory Templates
The factory runs purpose-built factory templates.  This section will walk you through how to install the available templates. 
<details>
<summary>Public Sector Factory Templates</summary>
All Public Sector template repositories are pre-fixed with PST; for example, "PST- HHS Program Support Desk." The Digital Product Factory for Public Sector is part of the Digital Product Factory Core but you will need to install the templates below or create your own templates for the factory to function.
	
**List of Available Public Sector Factory Templates:**
1. **PST - HHS Program Support Desk** https://github.com/jspirkosn/PST---HHS-Program-Support-Desk
1. **PST - Licensing and Permitting** https://github.com/jspirkosn/PST---Licensing-and-Permitting
</details>
<details>
<summary>Financial Services Factory Templates</summary>
All Financial Services template repositories are pre-fixed with FST; for example, "FST - Power of Attorney." The Digital Product Factory for Financial Services is part of the Digital Product Factory Core but you will need to install the templates below or create your own templates for the factory to function.

# Creating New Factory Templates
This section provides the details needed to build and add a new template to the Digital Product Factory.
1. Open App Engine Studio and Go to Templates
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6853d7d-c21d-4496-a8fa-3fb2d1fc3d73)
1. hover over any of the existing factory templates and choose "use template"
1. When the app creator comes up, choose a name that represents your new template but don't name it the same as your template
1. In the example below, I'm creating a template for licensing and permitting, so I named it "Pub Sub" to represent a Public Sector Sub-App and "licenses and permits" to represent the type of services the app will provide
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c0d66bb-cea3-42bb-af85-0d8efbc3614e)
1. You now have an app that your template will be based on, as shown below
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74884486-f00c-4a24-8b91-9821388580d2)
1. Configure the app that will be the basis for the template
	- Configure Tables
		- Use the {program name} tag in your table labels (A factory workflow will replace that tag with the Product Name)
 		- In the next step, you will create at least one record producer for each of these tables (these tables should extend the industry model tables and comply with the industry reference architecture) 
	- Configure the record producers
		- There are two types of record producers: one used on the Service Delivery Side and the other on the Service Support side. The difference between the two is in the objects associated with them by the factory. The support side records producers are classified according to the CSDM, and the delivery side uses the industry data models provided by the ServiceNow industry teams. 
		- For the support type, the factory populates the business service and provides a list selector for the offering (Note: you can only submit tasks against the services contained in this product)
 		- For the support type, use the {program name support} tag in the label; this is how the factory knows to pre-populate the business service, and the service offering selector is dependent on it
		- For the support type, you must leave the Business Service ID and the Service Offering questions on the record producer for the factory to populate them; see example below
		  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c43f56c-c46a-452c-bcfb-f03b1f94b77b)
 
 	 	
		- For the delivery type, the factory populates the product model, service (CSM Service, not CSDM service), and assignment group 
		- For the delivery type, use the {program name deliver} tag in the label; this is how the factory knows to pre-populate the product model, assignment group, and case type
		- For the delivery type, you must leave the Product, Service, and Assignment Group questions on the record producer for the factory to populate them; see example below
		  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b98ae6-fe9a-44c9-9448-dd2cbf8b0a5b)
	- Configure the playbook and flows
		- Do not alter the {program name} Initialize flow; the factory calls this flow to configure the application 
		- Use the {program name} tag in your table labels (A factory workflow will replace that tag with the Product Name)
  		  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947e14ce-0e11-4a41-9336-6f9da2c0b006)
