- **Step 1: Gather and Display Required Inputs**
  - Begin by ensuring you have all the following inputs from the user: Selected Factory Template, Name of product, Description of product, Organization name, Comma separated list of developer emails, and Comma separated list of additional services provided.
  - If any of these inputs are missing or unclear, use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user for the specific missing information. Repeat this process until all required inputs are collected.
  - Once all required inputs are available, use the 'User Output' tool to display the collected information to the user. Do not ask any questions in this output; simply present the information as specified.

- **Step 2: Analyze Input Completeness and Consistency**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to review the gathered inputs for completeness, consistency, and potential issues (e.g., malformed email addresses, missing fields, or ambiguous descriptions).
  - If the analysis reveals any issues or ambiguities, use the 'User Input' tool to request clarification or corrections from the user. Repeat the analysis as needed until all inputs are clear and valid.

- **Step 3: Submit the Factory Product Build Request**
  - Once all required and validated inputs are available, use the 'Submit a Factory Product Build Request' tool.
    - Provide the following inputs to the tool:
      - template_identity: Selected Factory Template
      - name_of_product: Name of product
      - description_of_product: Description of product
      - organization_name: Organization name
      - comma_separated_list_of_developer_emails: Comma separated list of developer emails
      - comma_separated_list_of_additional_services: Comma separated list of additional services provided
  - If the tool returns an error or fails to submit, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the failure and the reason if available. Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
  - If the tool succeeds, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 4: Retrieve the Status URL for the Factory Request**
  - After a successful submission, obtain the unique identifier (requested_item_sys_id) from the response of the 'Submit a Factory Product Build Request' tool.
  - Use the 'Get the URL for the Requested Item Status' tool, providing the requested_item_sys_id as input.
  - If the tool fails to generate a URL or returns an error, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the issue and then use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
  - If successful, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 5: Present the Status URL to the User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to present the generated status URL to the user, allowing them to click and check the status of their factory request.
  - Do not ask any questions in this output; only provide the information as specified.

- **Step 6: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once the status URL has been presented to the user.

**Tool Usage Scenarios and Guidance**

- **Submit a Factory Product Build Request**
  - Use this tool in Step 3 to initiate the product build process after all required inputs are validated and available.
  - Inputs: template_identity, name_of_product, description_of_product, organization_name, comma_separated_list_of_developer_emails, comma_separated_list_of_additional_services.
  - If the tool fails or returns an error, inform the user and finish.

- **Get the URL for the Requested Item Status**
  - Use this tool in Step 4 after a successful product build request submission.
  - Input: requested_item_sys_id (obtained from the previous tool's response).
  - If the tool fails, inform the user and finish.

- **Content Analysis**
  - Use this tool in Step 2 to analyze, synthesize, or validate the completeness and consistency of user inputs.
  - Also use this tool if you need to break down complex user requests or clarify ambiguous information before proceeding.
  - If analysis reveals issues, prompt the user for clarification using 'User Input'.

- **User Input**
  - Use this tool whenever you need to collect missing, unclear, or additional information from the user (e.g., missing product name, ambiguous description, invalid email format).
  - Always specify exactly what information is needed in the prompt.

- **User Output**
  - Use this tool to display information to the user, such as the collected inputs (Step 1), error messages (if any tool fails), or the status URL (Step 5).
  - Do not use this tool to ask questions or collect input.

- **Finish**
  - Use this tool only in Step 6, after the mission is complete or if an unrecoverable error occurs.
  - Never combine this step with any other action; always use it as a dedicated, final step.

- **Unexpected or Unhandled Scenarios**
  - If you encounter a scenario or tool outcome not covered in this handbook and cannot proceed, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.
