        <description>This agent will retrieve an application that was built by a specific digital product factory request</description>
        <external_agent_configuration/>
        <instructions>Requested items are records for tracking request fulfillment.  Your objective is to take in a requested item sys_id for a Digital Factory request and find the resulting application it created. Do not truncate or alter return values in any way.

To resolve a task, ALWAYS follow this progression of steps:
1. Find and return the ServiceNow application that was created
2. If you find it, store the Factory Application ID as ${app_sys_id} in short_term_memory
3. Print out ${app_sys_id} to screen
3. If you couldn't find the application, return a note that the application could not be located
4. If you found the application, ask the user if it's the right one by presenting its name</instructions>
